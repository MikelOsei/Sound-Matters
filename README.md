# Sound Matters
Sound Matters is an interactive artwork that combines sound as input, with 3D visuals and ambient lighting to create an atmospheric scene that viewers can physically affect with their voices. This piece can repeat itself, but never in the same way, as there is a degree of randomness in the agents’ behaviour and state transitions.

Please see my artist statement for more details.

Created as Assignment 1 for UWaterloo's CS/FINE 383 Winter 2026 offering.
